  Abstract                 = {Usability evaluation of mobile applications can be a time-consuming
task, especially due to the fact that field studies are often
more suitable than laboratory evaluations. However, good user interface
design can make the difference between product acceptance and rejection
in the marketplace, and is therefore of high relevance for application
developers. In this paper, we present an innovative approach for the
automated evaluation of the usability of a mobile application, which is
based on the background observation and analysis of a user’s behavior
when using the application under real-life conditions. We present first
results of our ongoing research work on a usability evaluation framework,
which should help developers to make mobile applications easier to learn,
easier to use and aesthetically more pleasing, and thus lead to a higher
usability and acceptance of the applications.},
