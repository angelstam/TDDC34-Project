\section{Introduction}
This report was as an evaluation project of the course in technical,
economical and societal evaluation of IT-products in Link√∂ping
University.

\subsection{Background}
In this section, we present some basic background information on
vending machines, Quickomat, usability of information systems and
safety condition about public transportation. We will introduce the
main motivation and goals for this report, as well as the framework
and methodology we studied for the evaluation of this area.

\subsection{Quickomat}
Quickomat is a vending machine which is operated by the company
Quickomat AB. The machine is often found at public places such as
train stations, shopping malls and universities in the south of
Sweden. Through the machines Quickomat offers public transport
authorities and operators a service for ticket sales.

Using the Quickomat service, operators can easily sell their tickets
from hundreds of new locations without any investments in
infrastructure. Customers can buy tickets for public transportation
and concerts or top-up their mobile phone account from the nearest
machine. In 2008 the company had around 50 machines in use,
\cite{RealDeals2008}.
